/// Does an insitu replacement on the file located at [path].

/// [replace] searches the file at [path] for any occurances

///
/// By default we only replace the first occurance of [existing] on each line.
/// To replace every (non-overlapping) occurance of [existing] on a
/// line then set [all] to true;
///
/// The [replace] method returns the no. of lines modified.
///
/// During the process a tempory file called [path].tmp is created
/// in the directory of [path].
/// The modified file is written to [path].tmp.
/// Once the replacement completes successfully the file at [path]
/// is renamed to [path].bak, [path].tmp is renamed to [path] and then
/// [path].bak is deleted.

/// The above process essentially makes replace atomic so it should
/// be impossible to loose your file. If replace does crash you may
/// have to delete [path].tmp or [path].bak but this is highly unlikely.
