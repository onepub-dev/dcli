/// The [RunException] will contain the non-zero exit code.
///
/// As stderr is written to the console the associated error message
/// will have been written to the console before the command exists.
///
/// if the [nothrow] argument is true then a non-zero exit code will
/// NOT result in an exception. Instead the [run] method will return the
/// exit code. Again any error message will have been written to the console

///
/// If you pass a [workingDirectory] the command will run in the
/// given [workingDirectory]. If the [workingDirectory] is not specified
/// then the command will be run in the current working directory.

/// Use the [runInShell] argument if you need your command to be spawned

/// The [privileged] argument attempts to escalate the priviledge that
///  the command is run
/// at.
/// If the script is already running in a priviledge environment this s
/// witch will have no
/// affect.
/// Running a command with the [privileged] switch may cause the OS to
/// prompt the user

/// Current [privileged] is only supported under Linux.

/// DCli performs glob (wildcard) expansion on command arguments if it
/// contains any one
/// of *, [ or ?  unless the argument is quoted.
/// DCli uses the dart package Glob (https://pub.dev/packages/glob) to do the glob expansion.
///
/// The following command will have the argument containing the
/// wild card *.dart expanded to
/// the list of files, in the current directory, that match the
/// pattern *.dart. If no files match the pattern then the pattern
/// will be passed to the command unchanged:
///
/// ```dart
/// run('ls *.dart');
/// ```
///
/// If you add quotes around the wild card then it will not be expanded:
///
/// ```dart
/// run('find . -name "*.dart"', workingDirectory: HOME);
/// ```
///
/// Run the command and do not throw an exception if a non-zero
/// exist code is returned.
///
/// ```dart
/// int exitCode = run('ls *.dart', nothrow=true);
/// ```
///
/// The run function is syncronous and a such will not return
/// until the command completes.
///
/// The [nothrow] argument is EXPERIMENTAL
///
/// See:
///  * [start]
///  * [startFromArgs]
///  for methods that allow you to process data rather
/// than just outputing it to the cli.
